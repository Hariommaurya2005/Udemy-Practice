    <h1>HARIOM MAURYA </h1>
    <P style="font-size: x-large;">I'm a Full Stack Web Developer proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies. On the front-end, I craft visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Meanwhile, on the back-end, I excel in server-side languages like Python, Ruby, and Node.js to ensure smooth logic and database management. With expertise in database handling, version control using Git, and web hosting, I create robust digital landscapes. My goal is to seamlessly blend design with functionality, solving problems, optimizing performance, and contributing to a seamless online experience.
